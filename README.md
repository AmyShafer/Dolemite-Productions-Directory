# Dolemite Productions Directory

Dolemite is my name and finding out information about my production company is my game! This application could also go by CMS or a Content Management System. At this joint, we decided that DPD or Dolemite Productions Directory was more our style but you can call us whatever you like, Baby! We just hope that you find our coding capabilities are out of sight!

## Technologies

Dolemite's Directory was created using Node.js, MySQL2, Inquirer, JavaScript, and Kung-Fu! 

## Mockup

## Resources Used

In coding, it works best if you code what you know, and with Google, you can always know a little more! This directory incorporated module exports for a cleaner coding experience but the crew needed a refresher to get things goin' just right!

Inquirer's a trip but it don't havta trip a sista up! This link was very helpful for getting the directory's prompts in order!

Here at DPD, we hadn't messed with the splice method in a while so we looked up this toy problem from ages ago. Man, it did the trick!

## Future Improvements

In the future, DPD would like to organize our code so it's easier to follow. We did our best but things gotta little crazy, you know how it goes! 

Also, DPD would like to it make is so the databases remain organized alphabetically, regardless of if the user adds or removes elements.

## Learn More

This project was inspired by real-life legend Rudy Ray Moore and his daring contributions to Black American Culture. Moore's surprisingly irresistible alter-ego, Dolemite, earned him the title of "The Grandfather of Rap" and quickly became a Blaxploitation fan favorite!

You can and should learn more about Dolemite by watching the following films:

* ["Dolemite" -1975- on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Dolemite-Rudy-Ray-Moore/dp/B07DQ5MRZZ)

* ["Dolemite Is My Name" -2019- on Netflix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ws1YIKsuTjQ)
